## Overview

This project was built while learning how to work with APIs in JavaScript Scrimba's [Frontend Career Path courses](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

The Figma mockup was provided by Scrimba and the app was built entirely from scratch by me.

### The Challenge

#### Basic Requirements

- Two pages: index.html and watchlist.html
- Index = search page. Calls to OMDb API with the title searched for and displays search results
- Button to ‚Äúadd to watchlist‚Äù, which saves that data to local storage
- Watchlist.html loads and displays data from local storage

#### Stretch Goals

- N/A

### Showcase Screenshots

### Links

- Live URL: 

## My Process

2. Create GitHub repo & README
3. Create project folder structure
4.

### Built With

HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS & The Open Movie Database API

### What I Learned
